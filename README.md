2. **HuggingFace Spaces** — Community-hosted demos with instant model testing and open-source visibility.
3. **Anthropic Claude UI** — Minimal, safety-focused interface prioritizing clarity, structured outputs, and artifacts.
4. **Microsoft Copilot Lab** — Task-driven templates and guided workflows for productivity.

## Selected Features

- Prompt Editor with Templates and Save/Load  
- Parameters Panel (temperature, max tokens)  
- Response View (chat-style output + artifacts)  
- Save Prompt as Template  
- Dark / Light mode toggle

## How to run
1. `npm install`  
2. `npm run dev`  
3. Open `http://localhost:3000`
